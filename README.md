# Cosmetic-Sales-Dashboard
I recently completed an Excel dashboard project (Cosmetic Sales Dashboard) that visualizes key performance data for a cosmetic company. The dashboard includes various dynamic charts and slicers for detailed analysis, as well as KPIs summarizing Total Revenue, Total Quantity Sold, and Total Discounts.
The dashboard is structured as follows:
1. Revenue Contribution by Day (Column Chart)
This chart showcases the revenue breakdown by day, with Wednesday and Thursday standing out as the top-performing days.
Toggle Option: Switch between viewing the data as a percentage or in actual value.
Slicers: You can highlight specific days, like Monday or Friday, for a closer look by selecting them from the slicer.
2. Revenue Contribution by Year (Column Chart)
This chart displays revenue over the years from 2017 to 2020, with 2018 being the peak revenue year and 2020 the lowest.
Toggle Option: Switch between percentage or value views.
Slicers: When you select a year, like 2018, it highlights that year’s data for focused analysis.
3. Revenue Contribution by Region (Column Chart)
This chart illustrates revenue distribution by region, with the North region leading and the South region trailing in revenue.
Toggle Option: View revenue in percentage or value.
Slicers: Selecting a region will highlight its contribution, helping analyze regional performance.
4. Revenue by Weektype (Pie Chart)
A pie chart shows the revenue contribution by weektype, revealing that weekdays account for a striking 77% of total sales, highlighting the importance of weekday business.
5. Revenue by Master Category (Scatter Chart)
This scatter chart displays revenue contributions by master categories, numbered from 1 to 12, with Category 11 generating the highest sales.
6. Revenue Share by State (Treemap Chart)
The treemap chart illustrates revenue share by state, where Delmdk leads, followed closely by Mohali. The visual arrangement provides a clear comparison of each state’s revenue contribution.
This Excel dashboard offers an in-depth view of the business, allowing users to switch between percentage and value views and interact with slicers to drill down into specific data points.
